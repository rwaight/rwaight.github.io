!!! note "Official Docs"

    The official **MkDocs** site is [https://www.mkdocs.org](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and the official 
    **Material for MkDocs** site is [https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

???+ info

    This MkDocs resources section is a work in progress, just like the rest of the site.


!!! abstract "Current section plans"

    The plan for this section is to include resources for anyone learning to configure and deploy MkDocs.
    This 'resources' section is meant to include 'random notes'; MkDocs 'best practices' should be stored 
    in the [MkDocs references](../../references/mkdocs/) section. 



### Using Material for MkDocs with GitHub Pages

This site is hosted with GitHub Pages using [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/){:target="_blank"}. The `frontmatter` is used for [YAML style meta-data](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/#yaml-style-meta-data){:target="_blank"}.
