Not exactly the asked for question (to see commits on all branches), but to see a commit on a specific branch of a github repository -
```shell
https://github.com/<repository_name>/commits/<branch_name>?author=<user_name>
```

eg.

- Repository: langchain-ai/langchain
- Branch: master
- Author: sepiatone
- https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/commits/master?author=sepiatone
