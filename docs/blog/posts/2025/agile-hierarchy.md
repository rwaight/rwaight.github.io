In distributed teams, having a shared understanding of Agile terminology is essential to working effectively. This post explains the hierarchy of Agile work items and how they fit together to support clarity, alignment, and execution.

## 🧩 Work Item Hierarchy Overview

    %% subgraph first, so switching them here
    subgraph Initiative 2
        I2E1[Epic]
        I2E2[Epic]
        I2S1["Story: 'What?' & 'Why?'"]

        I2S1 --> I2T1
        I2S1 --> I2T2
        I2S2 --> I2T3
        I2S2 --> I2T4
    end

        I1T1["Task: 'How?'"]
        I1T2["Task: 'How?'"]

        I1S1 --> I1T2
        I1S2 --> I1T3
        I1S2 --> I1T4
    end

    Initiative1[Initiative 1] --> I1E1
    Initiative1 --> I1E2
    Initiative2[Initiative 2] --> I2E1
    Initiative2 --> I2E2

|:--------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Task**       | The **"how?"** – implementation-level steps proving stories are fulfilled. |
| **Story**      | The **"what?"** and **"why?"** – user-centric requirements with criteria.  |
| **Epic**       | A collection of related stories forming a larger feature.                  |
| **Initiative** | Strategic objective spanning multiple epics.                               |

### Quick Analogy:

> **Stories = Requirements**.
> **Tasks = Implementation.**

## 🌍 Why It Matters for Distributed Teams

- ✍️ **Shared Vocabulary**: Avoids confusion across locations.
- 🎯 **Goal Alignment**: Connects daily work to strategic initiatives.
- 🔍 **Traceability**: Tasks trace back to story requirements.
