<!--- # Version Control --->

Version control, also known as _source control_, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to your codebase using Git. This section contains references and best practices related to tracking and managing changes to code.

> **Note:** "Version Control" and "Source Control" are used interchangeably. For an introduction, see GitHubâ€™s documentation:

> - [What is version control?](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-version-control)
> - [GitHub Version Control Basics](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git)


!!! abstract "Current section plans"

    This 'references' section is meant to include 'best practices'; any random notes should be stored in the [version-control resources](../../resources/version-control/) section. 
    The plan for this section is to include references about good version control practices, 
    including the use of version control software, git hygiene, proper commit messages, pull request practices, and using version control software with a team.
