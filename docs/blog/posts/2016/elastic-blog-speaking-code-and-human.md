!!! quote "Elastic Support: Speaking Code and Human"

    I've worked in support for over twenty years — specifically in open source — and I can confidently say that support at Elastic is unlike anything else that exists out there.

    I mean, I don't know if you know, but typically, support sucks.

    And being in support sucks even more (just ask any support engineer you know).

    Why do I say this?

    Well, some software you buy doesn't always do what you were told it would. It's not as good as the packaging claims. This happens for a number of reasons: egos, cathedral building (when customer feedback doesn't make it back to engineering), marketing and sales being pressured to hit certain numbers no matter what it takes, etc.

    This gives customers certain expectations of how a product should perform, and when it doesn't work the way it's advertised … you know who has to absorb all that pain?

    Yeah, you know the answer.

I've worked in support for over twenty years — specifically in open source — and I can confidently say that support at Elastic is unlike anything else that exists out there.

## At Elastic, things are different.
It starts with having empathy for our users.

***Supporting our users and making them successful is encoded into our DNA.***

How can I explain it? I'll take you frame-by-frame it (bonus points if you get this reference).

It starts with our very first support engineer. Do you know who that was? This guy named Shay Banon, Elastic co-founder and creator of Elasticsearch. Back in 2010 when Shay created Elasticsearch, he was the only person 'responsible' for supporting the developers who were using the software — answering questions on IRC and mailing lists (check out this exchange between Shay and Clinton Gormley, who joined Elastic two years later and ended up co-authoring Elasticsearch: The Definitive Guide), reviewing and merging pull requests on GitHub … and, you know, continuing to build the software, too. NBD. That's open source, right?

But just keep in mind that's our roots.

That's where we came from.

That's where we were born.

And things evolved along the same path from there.
