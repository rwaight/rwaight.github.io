# Setting up a blog

From https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/plugins/blog/

> Material for MkDocs makes it very easy to build a blog, either as a sidecar to your documentation or standalone. Focus on your content while the engine does all the heavy lifting, automatically generating archive and category indexes, post slugs, configurable pagination and more.
