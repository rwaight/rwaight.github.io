We\u2019ll review a few methods for advanced individuals to list all accounts, both user and system, on any Mac with any version of Mac OS X system software.</p> <p>A few preliminary basic approaches to this would be to access the login screen or to list the contents of the /Users directory, though if a user account is hidden then it would not display at the login screen and it\u2019s equally simple to obfuscate a user from the /Users folder. Additionally, the existence of a name in the /Users/ directory is not foolproof, because you can delete a user account but preserve that users home directory. As a result, while those approaches may be appropriate for the casual Mac user looking to show what users they have on a computer, neither of those methods are particularly sufficient for most admin needs. But, by turning to the command line you can reveal all user accounts on a Mac, whether they are general user accounts of active users, admin accounts, as well as any system account.</p>"},{"location":"something/#how-to-list-all-user-accounts-on-a-mac-from-command-line","title":"How to List All User Accounts on a Mac from Command Line","text":"<p>Open the Terminal if you haven\u2019t done so already, either on the local machine you want to list user accounts for, or by connecting to a remote Mac you\u2019d like to see the user accounts on.

A user story is typically functionality that will be visible to end users and captures requirements and acceptance criteria from the user's perspective. Developing a user story usually involves multiple roles such as a programmer, tester, user interface designer, or analyst, indicating that it contains multiple types of work. 03</p> <p>On the other hand, a task is a unit of work that is generally worked on by one person and is restricted to a single type of work. Tasks are implementation activities designed to prove that the requirements and acceptance criteria of user stories have been met. They are often technical in nature, such as implementing a class, setting up a virtual machine, writing a script, or conducting UI testing. 02</p> <p>In the context of Jira, a popular tool for Agile project management, a Story is a more specific version of a Task. Both are work requests, but a Story was created to help people tracking User Stories in Jira. Tasks in Jira are considered \"units\" of work and are often used for activities that are not testable, whereas stories are for functionalities that can be tested and potentially shipped. 04</p> <p>Scrumban, a hybrid of Scrum and Kanban, utilizes both concepts but emphasizes visualizing work, limiting work in progress, and maximizing efficiency. In Scrumban, tasks are represented as cards on a Kanban board, moving through different stages of the process, while stories are part of the product backlog and are prioritized based on complexity and product demand. 07</p> <p>The key to distinguishing between a story and a task lies in understanding that stories bring functionality and value that is recognizable to the user, while tasks are the steps taken by developers to realize that functionality. 02 This distinction helps in organizing work in a way that aligns with both the user's needs and the team's capacity to deliver. 08</p>","tags":["Agile","Kanban","Scrum"]},{"location":"blog/2025/02/04/using-scrumban-in-a-distributed-team/","title":"Using Scrumban in a distributed team","text":"Note <p>While this document is not in draft mode it is definitely not complete...</p> <p>Being flexible and efficient can make working in a distributed team a great experience; sometimes though, you have to be the agent of change to help your team get there.

I wanted it to be full-width (that is, <code>width: 100%</code>), but keep the normal YouTube aspect ratio. I wanted it to behave like an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>, where the image file contains its fixed aspect ratio, which the browser uses to lay out the image appropriately.</p> <p>Unlike <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>s, <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>s don't have a fixed aspect ratio, because <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>s embed web pages, which don't have fixed/known aspect ratios. But for the particular case of YouTube videos, there is a fixed aspect ratio we want: the standard <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> has <code>width=\"560\" height=\"315\"</code>, which simplifies to a 16:9 aspect ratio. Can we tell the browser to display an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> at <code>width: 100%; aspect-ratio: 16:9;</code>?</p> <p>There is no <code>aspect-ratio</code> property, but we can do this with CSS. The <code>16:9</code> aspect ratio corresponds to a height which is <code>56.25%</code> of the width. To make a CSS box which is <code>56.25%</code> of its own width, we can use the <code>padding-top</code> property with a percentage. The percentage is proportional to the width of the parent element, so first, we create a parent element to define the width, then insert a child element to define the height. Like this:</p> <pre><code>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div style=\"padding-top: 56.25%;background-color: yellow;\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Next, we put the <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> inside this box, making it fill the whole box. To size the <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>, we ignore the <code>width=\"560\" height=\"315\"</code> element properties, and instead use the CSS properties <code>width:100%;height:100%;</code>.</p> <pre><code>&lt;div&gt;\n  &lt;div style=\"padding-top:56.25%;background-color: yellow;\"&gt;\n    &lt;iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nckseQJ1Nlg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen\n      style=\"width:100%;height:100%;\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Oh no, that's not right at all! The <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> is not the right height, and it's not positioned correctly. We can fix these with the <code>position</code> attribute:</p> <pre><code>&lt;div&gt;\n  &lt;div style=\"position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;\"&gt;\n    &lt;iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nckseQJ1Nlg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen\n      style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>That's it: a full-width <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> with fixed aspect ratio.

using libvirt","text":"<p>From https://nathanchance.dev/posts/github-actions-fedora-libvirt/</p> <p>Recently, I started exploring setting up a self-hosted GitHub Actions runner for the work-in-progress LLVM builds that ClangBuiltLinux is looking to distribute on kernel.org, as GitHub Actions hosted runners are pretty underwhelming in terms of performance and we want to soup these builds up with Profile Guided Optimization. Additionallly, GitHub Actions does not have a hosted arm64 Linux option, which is becoming increasingly important with chips such as Apple's M1 getting strong mainline Linux support.</p> <p>In this guide, I'll go over how I set up a Fedora virtual machine using libvirt to run GitHub Actions workflows, including some of the oddities I ran into. This is not intended to be an end all be all guide but I believe it is important to share knowledge, as I am unlikely to be the last person looking to do this.</p>","tags":["GitHub","GitHub/Actions","Virtualization"]},{"location":"random/github/github-actions-fedora-libvirt/#set-up-libvirt","title":"Set up libvirt","text":"<p>I recommend running GitHub Actions in a virtual machine, which ensures that if you ever mess up a workflow or command, you are not risking damaging your host operating system. libvirt seems to be one of the most popular and well supported virtualization solutions on Linux so that is what I went with for this project.</p> <p>Getting libvirt installed and configured varies by distribution, so I cannot really get too specific here. There are guides for Arch Linux, Debian, and Fedora. The important steps are making sure that the <code>libvirtd</code> service is enabled and started and your user is a part of the <code>libvirt</code> group (or whatever the <code>libvirt</code> specific group is on your distribution).</p> <p>A few notes of issues/quirks I ran into:</p> <ol> <li> <p>libvirt has different URIs (system and session), which have different permissions. I hate using <code>sudo</code> if I do not have to ensure I am not messing my system up unnecessarily. By default, without root, you are in a user session, which only has access to QEMU's user networking mode, instead of the default network, which is faster. Additionally, autostarting virtual machines on boot (which we want for a runner, which should be as available for jobs as possible) is only available for system URIs. If you are part of the <code>libvirt</code> group, you can access <code>qemu:///system</code> without root but you have to specifically request it via the <code>--connect</code> parameter to <code>virsh</code> and <code>virt-install</code>. To avoid doing that for every single command, you can the <code>LIBVIRT_DEFAULT_URI</code> environment variable to <code>qemu:///session</code> in your shell start up file (example for fish). This will make <code>virsh</code> and <code>virt-install</code> use the system URI by default so that everything \"just works TM\".</p> </li> <li> <p>The default network uses network address translation (NAT) via <code>iptables</code> to route traffic to and from the virtual machine. As a result, the virtual machine is not accessible to the network, which is just fine for our use case. If you need more flexibility, check out the libvirt Networking Handbook, which was very informative. I will be concerned with the default network for the rest of this guide.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you are starting virtual machines on boot and you have set the machine to use KVM, the KVM modules must be in your initrd so that they are loaded before init starts, otherwise you might see an error like <code>\"unsupported configuration: Domain requires KVM, but it is not available. Check that virtualization is enabled in the host BIOS, and host configuration is setup to load the kvm modules.\"</code>. Again, this varies by distribution; for Arch Linux, you can add your vendor module (<code>kvm_amd</code> or <code>kvm_intel</code>) to the <code>MODULES</code> array in <code>/etc/mkinitcpio.conf</code> and regenerate all initrds with <code>mkinitcpio -P</code>.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Once it is installed, make sure that the default network is set to automatically start on boot:</p> <pre><code>$ virsh net-autostart default\n</code></pre> <p>Make sure that the default network is currently started:</p> <pre><code>$ virsh net-start default\n</code></pre> <p>If it fails saying it is already started, that is obviously fine.</p>","tags":["GitHub","GitHub/Actions","Virtualization"]},{"location":"random/github/github-actions-fedora-libvirt/#create-and-set-up-fedora-virtual-machine","title":"Create and set up Fedora virtual machine","text":"<p>GitHub Actions supports a few different distributions for the self-hosted runner application.

Click \"Linux\" and select the correct architecture of the virtual machine.</p> <p>Follow the Download instructions (they are copy and paste). The validation step has <code>shasum -a 256</code>, I had to change that to <code>sha256sum</code> on Fedora.</p> <p>Run the first step under the \"Configure\" section:</p> <pre><code>$ ./config.sh --url ... --token ...\n</code></pre> <p>For the second step, we are not going to use <code>./run.sh</code>; instead, we are going to configure the systemd service that is generated from the <code>./config.sh</code> step.</p> <p>First, we need to install the service. I am assuming that you did not add the <code>runner</code> account to the <code>wheel</code> group so <code>sudo</code> will not work; we will use <code>su -c</code> + the <code>root</code> password instead, as this is a one-time setup steup.</p> <pre><code>$ su -c \"./svc.sh install runner\"\n</code></pre> <p>Next, I recommend installing a \"clean up\" script to match the hosted GitHub Actions workflow, where every workflow run is completely clean. We do this before the service is actually started to ensure the variable is added to the environment.</p> <pre><code>$ cat &lt;&lt;'EOF' &gt;\"$HOME\"/cleanup.sh\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nrm -frv \"${GITHUB_WORKSPACE%/*}\"\nEOF\n$ chmod +x \"$HOME\"/cleanup.sh\n</code></pre> <p>SELinux is enabled on Fedora, which makes the GitHub Actions service unhappy; this impact this script as well, since it is running under the GitHub Actions service context.</p> <pre><code>$ su -c \"semanage fcontext --add --type initrc_exec_t $HOME/cleanup.sh\"\n$ restorecon -v \"$HOME\"/cleanup.sh\n</code></pre> <p>Add the script to the environment of the runner:</p> <pre><code>$ echo \"ACTIONS_RUNNER_HOOK_JOB_COMPLETED=$HOME/cleanup.sh\" &gt;&gt;\"$HOME\"/actions-runner/.env\n</code></pre> <p>We need to do the same SELinux workaround for the service script:</p> <pre><code>$ su -c \"semanage fcontext --add --type initrc_exec_t $HOME/actions-runner/runsvc.sh\"\n$ restorecon -v \"$HOME\"/actions-runner/runsvc.sh\n</code></pre> <p>Finally, we start the runner!</p> <pre><code>$ su -c \"./svc.sh start\"\n</code></pre> <p>With any luck, you will now see the service started and you should be able to refresh the Runner setup screen on GitHub to see your runner in an idle status.</p> <p>At this point, if you want your runner to be available after a reboot of the host machine, mark it for autostart:</p> <pre><code>$ virsh autostart fedora\nDomain 'fedora' marked as autostarted\n\n\n$ virsh dominfo fedora\nId:             1\nName:           fedora\nUUID:

This secret will be used to authenticate and authorize the addition of the target repository's secret.</li> <li> <p>Use the <code>gh</code> CLI command: In your GitHub Actions workflow, use the <code>gh</code> CLI command to list the secrets in the target repository. You can do this using the following syntax: <pre><code>- name: List secrets in target repository\n  run: |\n    gh secret list --repo &lt;target-repo-owner&gt;/&lt;target-repo-name&gt;\n</code></pre> Replace <code>&lt;target-repo-owner&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;target-repo-name&gt;</code> with the actual owner and name of the target repository.</p> </li> <li> <p>Add the secret to the target repository: Use the <code>gh</code> CLI command again to add the secret to the target repository.

One would be the REST-like which provide get/post/put/delete where post is to the base and put/delete are often tied to the _id of the object that you are working with.
