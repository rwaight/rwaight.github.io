We\u2019ll review a few methods for advanced individuals to list all accounts, both user and system, on any Mac with any version of Mac OS X system software.</p> <p>A few preliminary basic approaches to this would be to access the login screen or to list the contents of the /Users directory, though if a user account is hidden then it would not display at the login screen and it\u2019s equally simple to obfuscate a user from the /Users folder. Additionally, the existence of a name in the /Users/ directory is not foolproof, because you can delete a user account but preserve that users home directory. As a result, while those approaches may be appropriate for the casual Mac user looking to show what users they have on a computer, neither of those methods are particularly sufficient for most admin needs. But, by turning to the command line you can reveal all user accounts on a Mac, whether they are general user accounts of active users, admin accounts, as well as any system account.</p>"},{"location":"something/#how-to-list-all-user-accounts-on-a-mac-from-command-line","title":"How to List All User Accounts on a Mac from Command Line","text":"<p>Open the Terminal if you haven\u2019t done so already, either on the local machine you want to list user accounts for, or by connecting to a remote Mac you\u2019d like to see the user accounts on.

This would include usernames like Paul, Bob, Jill, but also daemons, system accounts, and process users like networkd, windowserver, daemon, nobody, root, _spotlight, _ard, _appserver, _iconservices, and many more.</p> <p>If the complete list of users is thus undesirable, you can easily exclude all the _underscore daemon and process accounts by running the output through grep, as we\u2019ll show next.</p>"},{"location":"something/#show-user-accounts-only","title":"Show User Accounts Only","text":"<pre><code>dscl . list /Users | grep -v '_'\n</code></pre> <p>This command will filter out any of the _ underscore prefixed daemon users, which are not actually user accounts. You\u2019ll get a much shorter list of user names returned as a result, but you\u2019ll still find three user names included that are not typical user accounts, but are normal to be found on Mac OS X installs; daemon, nobody, and root.</p>"},{"location":"something/#show-all-user-accounts-user-directories-user-gecos-info-on-a-mac","title":"Show All User Accounts, User Directories, &amp; User GECOS Info on a Mac","text":"<p>Another approach would be to show and list a detailed account list of user accounts, the associated user account directory, and the user account GECOS info (which is usually a description of the account or a full user name).

machine using libvirt","text":"<p>From https://nathanchance.dev/posts/github-actions-fedora-libvirt/</p> <p>Recently, I started exploring setting up a self-hosted GitHub Actions runner for the work-in-progress LLVM builds that ClangBuiltLinux is looking to distribute on kernel.org, as GitHub Actions hosted runners are pretty underwhelming in terms of performance and we want to soup these builds up with Profile Guided Optimization. Additionallly, GitHub Actions does not have a hosted arm64 Linux option, which is becoming increasingly important with chips such as Apple's M1 getting strong mainline Linux support.</p> <p>In this guide, I'll go over how I set up a Fedora virtual machine using libvirt to run GitHub Actions workflows, including some of the oddities I ran into. This is not intended to be an end all be all guide but I believe it is important to share knowledge, as I am unlikely to be the last person looking to do this.</p>","tags":["GitHub","GitHub/Actions","Virtualization"]},{"location":"random/github/github-actions-fedora-libvirt/#set-up-libvirt","title":"Set up libvirt","text":"<p>I recommend running GitHub Actions in a virtual machine, which ensures that if you ever mess up a workflow or command, you are not risking damaging your host operating system. libvirt seems to be one of the most popular and well supported virtualization solutions on Linux so that is what I went with for this project.</p> <p>Getting libvirt installed and configured varies by distribution, so I cannot really get too specific here. There are guides for Arch Linux, Debian, and Fedora. The important steps are making sure that the <code>libvirtd</code> service is enabled and started and your user is a part of the <code>libvirt</code> group (or whatever the <code>libvirt</code> specific group is on your distribution).</p> <p>A few notes of issues/quirks I ran into:</p> <ol> <li> <p>libvirt has different URIs (system and session), which have different permissions. I hate using <code>sudo</code> if I do not have to ensure I am not messing my system up unnecessarily. By default, without root, you are in a user session, which only has access to QEMU's user networking mode, instead of the default network, which is faster. Additionally, autostarting virtual machines on boot (which we want for a runner, which should be as available for jobs as possible) is only available for system URIs. If you are part of the <code>libvirt</code> group, you can access <code>qemu:///system</code> without root but you have to specifically request it via the <code>--connect</code> parameter to <code>virsh</code> and <code>virt-install</code>. To avoid doing that for every single command, you can the <code>LIBVIRT_DEFAULT_URI</code> environment variable to <code>qemu:///session</code> in your shell start up file (example for fish). This will make <code>virsh</code> and <code>virt-install</code> use the system URI by default so that everything \"just works TM\".</p> </li> <li> <p>The default network uses network address translation (NAT) via <code>iptables</code> to route traffic to and from the virtual machine. As a result, the virtual machine is not accessible to the network, which is just fine for our use case. If you need more flexibility, check out the libvirt Networking Handbook, which was very informative. I will be concerned with the default network for the rest of this guide.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you are starting virtual machines on boot and you have set the machine to use KVM, the KVM modules must be in your initrd so that they are loaded before init starts, otherwise you might see an error like <code>\"unsupported configuration: Domain requires KVM, but it is not available. Check that virtualization is enabled in the host BIOS, and host configuration is setup to load the kvm modules.\"</code>. Again, this varies by distribution; for Arch Linux, you can add your vendor module (<code>kvm_amd</code> or <code>kvm_intel</code>) to the <code>MODULES</code> array in <code>/etc/mkinitcpio.conf</code> and regenerate all initrds with <code>mkinitcpio -P</code>.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Once it is installed, make sure that the default network is set to automatically start on boot:</p> <pre><code>$ virsh net-autostart default\n</code></pre> <p>Make sure that the default network is currently started:</p> <pre><code>$ virsh net-start default\n</code></pre> <p>If it fails saying it is already started, that is obviously fine.</p>","tags":["GitHub","GitHub/Actions","Virtualization"]},{"location":"random/github/github-actions-fedora-libvirt/#create-and-set-up-fedora-virtual-machine","title":"Create and set up Fedora virtual machine","text":"<p>GitHub Actions supports a few different distributions for the self-hosted runner application.
