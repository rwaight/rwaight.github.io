# Using Scrumban in a distributed team

Being flexible and efficient can make working in a distributed team a great experience; sometimes though, you have to be the agent of change to help your team get there.

These are notes based on the following resources:
- [Understanding the 4 Agile ceremonies][10]
- [Scrumban: Mastering two Agile methodologies][20]

### Agile Ceremony Summary

An Agile ceremony is an event in the [Agile process][11] when your team meets to discuss what their next course of action is.

## Agile Ceremonies

There are four major Agile ceremonies that happen during every sprint cycle. Before starting each ceremony, your team members should understand the purpose of each meeting and how it impacts the sprint.

### The 4 Agile ceremonies

1. The sprint planning meeting
2. The daily [stand-up meeting][30]
3. The sprint review meeting
4. The sprint retrospective meeting


## Intentionally timely

### Timeboxed meetings

As mentioned in the [stand-up meeting][30] wikipedia page, the [stand-up meetings][30] are intentionally timeboxed:
> The meetings are usually [timeboxed][31] to between 5 and 15 minutes, and take place with participants standing up to remind people to keep the meeting short and to-the-point.[6][32]


### Keep the meeting short

> The daily stand-up meeting (also known as a “daily scrum”, a “daily huddle”, “morning roll-call”, etc.) is simple to describe:
> 
> The whole team meets every day for a quick status update. We stand up to keep the meeting short.
> 
> That's it.
> 
> But this short definition does not really tell you the subtle details that distinguish an effective stand-up from a waste of time.
> 
> So how can you tell?

The answer to the question of an effective stand-up is addressed in the [It's Not Just Standing Up: Patterns for Daily Standup Meetings][32] article, which is linked from the [stand-up meeting][30] wikipedia page.
