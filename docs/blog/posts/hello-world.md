# Hello world!

I'm hosted with GitHub Pages.  You can create your own GitHub pages site by following [the GitHub Pages documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site).

You can also read through my [GitHub Pages setup guide](https://rwaight.github.io/guides/setup-github-pages/), which has information about using either [MkDocs Material](https://rwaight.github.io/guides/setup-github-pages/#mkdocs) or [Jekyll](https://rwaight.github.io/guides/setup-github-pages/#jekyll) with GitHub Pages.
