???+ info

    This site is a _work in progress_...


!!! abstract "Site Update Plan"

    The site is being restructured to include the following document sections:
    `blog`, `guides`, `random`, `references`, and `resources`.

### Site overview

- [Blogs](./blog/index.md)
- Restructuring:
    - These pages _will most likely_ be migrated to a different document section.
    - [Guides](./guides/index.md)
    - [Random pages](./random/index.md)
    - Currently working on separating the pages based on [either the information or knowledge provided](https://keydifferences.com/difference-between-information-and-knowledge.html)
- [References](./references/index.md)
    - Useful information: Baseline configurations or 'best practices' about specific topics.
- [Resources](./resources/index.md)
    - Mostly refined data: Information and random notes about different topics.
