!!! quote "Munchkin (Card Game)"

    ***Munchkin*** is a [dedicated deck card game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedicated_deck_card_game) by [Steve Jackson Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jackson_Games), 
    written by [Steve Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jackson_(US_game_designer)) and illustrated by [John Kovalic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kovalic). 
    It is a humorous take on [role-playing games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_games), based on the concept of [munchkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munchkin_(role-playing_games)) 
    (immature role-players, playing only to "win" by having the most powerful character possible). _from [Munchkin (card game)](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Munchkin_(card_game))
