???+ info

    This coding references section is a work in progress, just like the rest of the site.


!!! abstract "Current section plans"

    This 'references' section is meant to include 'best practices'; any random notes should be stored in the [coding resources](../../resources/coding/) section. 
    The plan for this section is to include references about good coding practices, including the use of version control software, 
    git hygiene, proper commit messages, pull request practices, and using version control software with a team.
