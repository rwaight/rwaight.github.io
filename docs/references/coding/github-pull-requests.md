Pull requests are used to submit code changes in GitHub; having a standard way to submit pull requests is beneficial in many ways.



## Items required before submitting the pull request

The following items are required before submitting the pull request:

1. A very clear and concise title
2. The **why** is this PR happening? What is it fixing or improving?
    - Describe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why this pull request should be accepted.
3. Proper **label** - Select the `type:` label that best describes the changes
    - Use [one of the **commit types** from this list](https://github.com/rwaight/rwaight.github.io/blob/main/commitlint.config.js).


### A very clear and concise title

This _should be_ [self-explanatory](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/self-explanatory).


### Why are you opening the pull request?

This should address the following:

- What are the proposed changes?
- In your own words, describe the big picture of your changes here.

### Adding the proper `type:` label

Select _only_ **one of** the proper `type:` label that best describes the changes being made.

- Use [one of the **commit types** from this list](https://github.com/rwaight/rwaight.github.io/blob/main/commitlint.config.js)
