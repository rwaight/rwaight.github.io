<!--- ## Work Tracking --->

As mentioned in the [_Using Scrumban in a distributed team_](./distributed-team-using-scrumban.md) post, using Sprints to plan and define the work that will be completed can be extremely helpful in a distributed team. There _should be_ a formally established process to follow in order to help everyone understand expectations.

### Terminology

<!--- from https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/epics-stories-themes --->

What are stories, epics, and initiatives? (from [`atlassian.com`][01])

- Stories, also called “user stories,” are short requirements or requests written from the perspective of an end user.
- Epics are large bodies of work that can be broken down into a number of smaller tasks (called stories).
- Initiatives are collections of epics that drive toward a common goal.
