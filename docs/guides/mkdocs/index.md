## Placeholder page for MkDocs guides


???+ note

    This page is missing content so this placeholder section is here until content is added.


???+ note

    Read through the [MkDocs "Writing your docs" guide](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/) and the [Material for MkDocs "Reference" guide](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/){:target="_blank"} for more information about using [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/){:target="_blank"}.


## Local install

!!! warning

    As mentioned in the [Material for MkDocs "getting started with docker" guide](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/#with-docker){:target="_blank"}, the Docker container is intended for local previewing purposes only and is not suitable for deployment. This is because the web server used by MkDocs for live previews is not designed for production use and may have security vulnerabilities.

The [local install guide](mkdocs-local-install.md) contains the recommended steps to run MkDocs locally.
